        <h1>Priyanka Das' Biography</h1>
        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>Hello all! My name is Priyanka Das (she/her), I am a sophomore at Syracuse University majoring in Information Management & Technology, Policy Studies, and a minor in Art History.</p>
        <p>Through various opportunities like a <strong>Program Management internship at NBCUniversal</strong> and being the Assistant Producer for First Year Players I have cemented strengths in adaptability while creating strong interpersonal relationships. <strong>Curating experience for others while blending my creative and hard skills</strong> drives my professional ambitions. Outside of my professional life, I enjoy playing pickleball, doing freelance lighting design, and love watching TV and eating tex-mex! In the future I would love to explore more opportunities in product development that combine my managerial skills with my creative passions!</p>
